Deep in the gloom of the concrete jungle lies hidden Bellbirdtown. Once it was a mere shantytown, but now it has a life of its own. You could walk around the area a dozen times and only come away with a dream-impression of it, like a mirage. It's made of piers and docks and waving white flags and structures built overtop of the water and each other, nestled away in a nook of the great wall that surrounds everything. It has depth, like some ancient city built atop of an even more impossibly ancient one. In truth it's less than six months old.

There is always singing in Bellbirdtown. Settle down and listen and you'll hear it. Sometimes it comes from hijacked loudspeakers, recordings of a beautiful song met with voices singing along. Sometimes it's the wind or the birds or the vibrations of your bones, and still the pious people's voices rise to meet it, greet it, exceed it. They rise to meet it even when it's screaming.

Today it calls them to gather first thing in the morning, while they're still rubbing the nightmares from their eyes. As always, they come wearing white. Their prophet walks barefoot down the cobblestones, kissing each of them in turn where it hurts most. Whispered instructions turn their eyes outwards, to the city that surrounds the city.

Brockton Bay.

---

Our Sabah wakes from a dream. Alarms blare around her. She sits up and hits her head on the bunk above. The spike of pain catches her senses up to the present.

Oh. It's just the one alarm this time.

Dazed, she shimmies to her feet. A blow to the alarm clock silences it. Sounds of terror echo down from above.

"Go back to sleep, Fatima," Sabah whispers.

She pulls on the underclothes and concealed needles of Parian's costume from where they've been clumsily discarded behind a chair, puts casual clothing over that, and shoves the rest of the costume into a dirty bag. She knows a few hidden places to change along the way.

Her cousin peers down at her. The nightmare hasn't yet faded from her face.

"Sorry about the alarm," Sabah adds habitually. Apologizing is easy, but meaning it is harder.

She pulls open the door.

It's a brand new day. Parian's up and at 'em.

---

Even in the early morning, the gloom of the city is omnipresent. Parian wanders down Captain's Hill, walking in the middle of the street. It's better to make your presence obvious, not to startle anyone.

"*Citizens of Brockton Bay,*" a pitch-deepened voice blares from a nearby loudspeaker, "*a homeless shelter has been established at the boat graveyard. Food and housing will be provided. Disregard any misinformation you hear on this subject.*"

After a long and suspicious look, she passes it by.

Sooner or later Parian finds herself downtown, in one of the least damaged areas. At this time of day only a dozen or so civilians are outside, only half seeming to know where they're going. A few cars pass by, but not many. It's almost normal. It would be easy to blend in here, even as a parahuman. Easy to forget.

She stops at a corner gas station, and hears her name called out in greeting. It's a plump, pleasant-looking woman, emerging from places unknown. Through probably the gas station interior, to be honest.

"Mrs. Cohen," Parian replies. She curtsies, and adds, "happy to meet you in person."

"Likewise, I'm sure. I hope your power is ready for a hard day's work."

That's when an employee comes dragging out the oversized mascot she's supposed to be advertising, getting it caught on several things along the way and needing help to pull it free. The thing is ten feet tall and shaped like a fat anthropomorphic rabbit, with skin the texture of rubber and a face closer to a smug cartoon beaver. Its mouth and legs are smeared in gasoline.

"Right," she manages. "I'd better get started."

This is Sabah's life. For hours she puppets the horrendous thing around, dancing and waving and waddling. It's too unwieldy to steer well, even with her power, creating a drunken gait. Small children shriek as they see it. Families steer away. A few more drivers pull up to the drive-thru, eyeing the mascot with bemused horror. More than usual, maybe? It's certainly attention-grabbing.

Bambina once told her that all publicity was good publicity.

Sabah remembers the days when she advertised with fashion brands, back when anyone had the luxury of caring about such things. She even finds herself thinking back to university fondly. And she fucking hated university.

When a few hours have passed, she notices Mrs. Cohen's return, eyeing Parian critically where she sits, partly concealed.

"Why don't you take a lunch break?" the boss suggests.

"Sure," Sabah says. "Um..."

"We have a break room. Oh, there are employees in there right now, though."

"I'll find a place nearby," Parian suggests, not about to unmask for them.

"Be back in fifteen!"

She ends up eating a sandwich in an alley. It's a good sandwich, so there's that, at least.

When she returns Mrs. Cohen has turned her judging eye upon the mascot itself. Parian stands at her side. 

"Ridiculous, isn't it?"

"It's a little..." she ventures.

Mrs. Cohen wheezes. "Trust me, I know. Ridiculous. Blame me for indulging my ex-wife's-" (Parian gives her a sidelong glance) "-delusion that she's a qualified graphic designer. Still, it grows on you."

*I could...* Parian forms the thought experimentally, *design you a new one, maybe?* Not *exactly* her area of expertise, but she'd have to be comatose to do much worse than this. And it would sure pay better than this gig. She's about to open her mouth, when...

"Ah, screw it. We only got you for the one day. Let's try out my other idea. Adnan! Bring out the other one!"

The same long-suffering employee appears lugging a large crab mascot, its expression one of cartoon horror.

"You... already have a new one?" Parian breathes.

"Don't get out much, do you? Exo is our biggest competition, and that right there is their pride and joy. Fuckers are so smug that all those new roadblocks are funnelling all the traffic their way. Well, you'll show them. Have Binky beat up the crab."

"I'm sorry?"

Mrs. Cohen gestures at the rabbit mascot like it's obvious. "Binky. Go wild, really lay into him. We filled the crab with blue stuffing that should fall out and look like blood as you rip him open. Sewed some organs, too. Oh, but don't make it end too quick. You're here till closing."

So Sabah does.

*Two grizzled combatants circle each other. They are warriors, their skills honed by a thousand conquests. Each has the scars to prove it. Each knows better than to underestimate his opponent. Each knows intimately: he who makes the first move loses.*

"You don't need to make it *that* slow. Have them fight already."

*But then, he who makes the first move sets the tempo for the fight. Exo rushes in. Binky backhands him, sending the crab flying comically into a car on the other side of the lot.*

"Careful, careful."

*Exo recovers and steps away from the vehicle gingerly. He plants himself on his belly with claws outstretched and spins like a top, closing the distance. Binky tilts his head in polite puzzlement. He grabs a claw in one oversized paw and crushes it. Blue crab's blood erupts from the wound. But this maneuver has cost the rabbit, other claws have ripped at his fur and poked holes in his fat belly.* 

"Lay him out!"

*Both warriors have tasted the other's blood and found it good. Now, Binky decides, is no longer the time for niceties. He puts all of his body weight into the next swing, a two-handed pound that breaks Exo's skeletal back. He strikes next with his feet, pushing the crab's head into the concrete and leaving him sputtering for breath. Blow after blow rains down, each rewarded with the taste of blood and the smell of victory. Death is in the air. But the fight is not yet decided.*

Distracted by her imagined bloodlust, Parian notices for the first time the crowd gathered to watch. The crab's blood paints them blue. She smiles under her mask, and the smile is wicked. She feels alive.

"Good, this is good!" Mrs. Cohen giggles madly. "Oh, can you do sound effects? No, of course you can't. Adnan!" she yells in the direction of the gas station interior. "Find me the recording of crabs dying! Yes. Yes! I *know* there's no internet, I downloaded it years ago. It's a cassette tape in my office, I listen to it when I'm feeling stressed!"

---

She slips into her home in full costume, hidden by the night and the gloom. The exhilaration she felt has long abandoned her, replaced by a paranoid melancholy. Her mother is passed out on the living room couch, watching a television tuned to dead static. Sabah shuts it off as she passes into her unlit room, where she finds Fatima already asleep. 

Their window is open, and though it only reveals an empty alleyway by sight, she can hear and recognize much beyond that. There are the chirping of crickets and other things, the pitter-patter of rat caravans scampering single-file through the gutters, the faint whoosh of loosely tossed missing persons posters lifted by the light breeze. Dark-hearted folk gather. Weapons are pulled from sheaths. Somewhere far in the distance, a scream rings out.

It's not too far in the distance.

As she undresses, Sabah takes a moment to breathe it all in. Then she lets go of her thoughts and they all come apart.

---

"Sabah," her mother calls.

"Morning, mom," Sabah breezes on by, "I've got to get to work."

"*Sabah*. Don't dare walk off on me again."

She stops.

"You think this is so easy for the rest of us," her mother asks scornfully, "don't you?"

Sabah shrugs.

"I can see it in your eyes. You think your power, or fighting with that army made you special. So now when you suffer, you say that we cannot possibly understand. The only thing to be done is to reject us."

"That's not what I think," Sabah mutters.

"Don't lie to me, child. Do you think I am blind? Do you think your family did not suffer when they herded us into a dark basement and locked us there? When we called out your name for hours, thinking you had been separated from us? Tell me what makes your pain so different, that I cannot understand it."

Sabah thinks of the fresh start she hoped to have, back on the day Brockton Bay became a new world. The same old family, but a new and mended relationship, in a better place. She remembers finding them in the aftermath, whispering tearful confessions in the days before the walls rose and the horror of the brave new world set in.

Change can't come from hope alone. Not in a place like this.

So she chose spite when it failed.

"I really do have to get to work. It's an early one."

"*Sabah*."

"It's important. Unless you want auntie to pull another double shift so we can afford groceries."

"Fine. Fine! Go, and run from this conversation again. You will regret it. If your father were-"

"*People of Brockton Bay,*" the loudspeaker interrupts from outside, voice pitched comically high this time, "*if your last name begins with A-L, you may be eligible to apply for mental health counselling. M-Z... we're very sorry.*"

For a moment, Sabah looks at her mother and sees her as she truly is. Then she's back to being a demon. 

*Maybe you should sign up,* she thinks righteously, *sounds like it might help*.

She turns to go. Behind her, she hears her mother gasp.

---

Parian pushes her way into the dark little shop. Knickknacks protrude from the walls and hang from the ceiling, leaving her barely a foot of space to manoeuvre. A soft voice comes to greet her.

"Ah. So you've come."

She locates today's client in the darkness: a very thin bald man behind the counter. He's white enough to be almost translucent, like a subterranean creature. Perhaps he is one.

"Hi there..." she trails off, disturbed. History-making words, for humanity's first contact with an alien species? Certainly not, but she can't think of better at the moment.

"Parian, yes? You may approach. I will tell you of your task."

She does approach, nearly tripping twice over unseen objects in the way. Each time a grimace flickers over the extraterrestrial's face.

"Sorry," she hiccups as she finally reaches the counter. She struggles to think back to the arrangement she made with this man a week ago, memories lost in the shuffle of small nonsense jobs. "You've, uh, got merch of heroes for me to advertise?"

The client leans forward intently. "Not heroes," he lilts, "just the one."

"Um?"

"*Vista*. Our homegrown hero of space. She once rescued my humble shop from being the collateral damage of Hookwolf the terrible. I'm told she rescued many others and their property much the same. Did you know of her?"

Fitting, she decides, that an extraterrestrial would take an interest in one with such a power. Evidence of a conspiracy is mounting.

"No, not really. She and Clockblocker showed up as security for one of my big events once," back when people were hiring for big events, "but I never spoke to her. And um, in the fight against Pazuzu's army, I saw her..."

She trails off. *Sell yourself.* How would he know either way?

"In the fight, we fought side by side. We didn't talk, but that was because we didn't need to. I protected her, and she used her power to grow my puppets to the size of houses. They mowed down half the army before they were, uh, popped."

The client is too unflappable to express his surprise at this, but Sabah can feel him hanging onto her every word. "And after that?"

"After that we were separated by the second wave. I... didn't see how she died. I saw her when the wave broke. She was lying on the ground with spikes through her abdomen. I tried to save her, but," she makes a sobbing sound, thankful for the mask because she doesn't know how to actually fake cry, "but it wasn't enough. She told me, 'look after the ones I saved.'"

She's not a very good storyteller, which makes her the perfect storyteller to tell this story in particular. A half-decent storyteller would tone this down, make the lie seem remotely realistic. A half-decent storyteller wouldn't have the audacity to pull what she's pulling.

Which is exactly why it works. The alien's mouth hangs open.

"Truly?" he says after a long time, "is this so? Perhaps it is fate that brought us together then, to honour Vista's memory."

"Yes," Parian agrees, fuming a little. Fate would have offered to pay her more for this job, to honour the memory of the girl she fought beside, the girl she nearly saved. Double, at least. But the client's already speaking of other things.

He tosses a series of objects onto the dark countertop. The gesture is lazy, but the knickknacks remain where they land, not rolling or even clattering on impact. Parian can hardly make them out in the unlit room.

"I have here... dolls in the likeness of Vista. A dozen, handmade by me. You will make them dance, and you will sell them. Puppets, much the same. I have charms made of the bones of small animals, in a V shape and painted green. It is said that they grant a portion of her aspect of space. You should advertise them as such. I have here also... lunchboxes. Vista themed lunchboxes, for the children. Visors in her style, that also function as sunglasses. Green handcuffs, for capturing villains. They are stretchy, much like space was to her, but still very firm. Also an angel Vista, to be placed at the top of the Christmas tree. Also I have..."

He goes on for some time, listing strange things whose association with Vista becomes increasingly tenuous, the strangeness only highlighted by the occasional extremely normal piece of PRT-branded merchandise to be resold.

"Okay," Parian responds after an indeterminate amount of time has passed, looking down at the indecipherable objects that have accumulated on the counter. "Would you mind turning a light on in here? I can't really see most of these."

"I cannot," the extraterrestrial snaps quickly, "you will have to abide by that."

"Oh. Sorry, is it another power outage? I saw the café next door has-"

"No, not the *power*. It is the hated one. You know of whom I speak."

Parian nods. Her mind is full of feathers.

"The light carries her messengers, and they wish to invade my shop and steal all that I've built. You have seen them about the town, for they wear her colour. The darkness keeps them blind. But you will not need to remain inside. You will sell these trinkets outside the shop. I have prepared for you a folding table and a poster showing prices. You will have a cashbox. I will be here, listening. You will direct those who seek further knowledge inward to me."

"That's fine," Parian agrees. In the new Brockton Bay, it's best to just go with it.

"There is one more thing," the client drops another thing onto the table, "I have here a costume..."

Twenty-five frustrating minutes of changing in the dark later she's outside the shop with the knickknacks arranged. She, of course, being Vista, the hero of space. Parian wears a visor over her normal mask and blonde wig, and green armour over her dress. It is the perfect disguise.

It's midmorning by now, and this part of the city being a pretty safe one, civilians are roaming without a care in the world. She only spots one single madman with a sign proclaiming the second coming of the beast being nigh, which is a low for her. It's almost like the old Brockton Bay. 

Sabah puts her game face on. The Vista dolls stand up and start dancing.

When the customers come she gives them what they want. An old woman buys a doll. A put-upon looking man buys a lunchbox. She directs a curious onlooker into the shop for things not Vista-themed. A child runs up to her, exclaiming that she knew Vista couldn't be dead, and throws her arms around Parian. The child's mother stalks up and pulls them apart, hissing that this isn't Vista, just a salesperson and a ghoulish display. Dragging her daughter away, the mother tells Sabah that she should be ashamed of herself. Sabah isn't fazed. This is her game face. She sells one of the special charms, making note of its supposed powers. She directs another customer into the shop.

"Quite the display," someone says. Parian looks up from her price sheet.

Three blond teenagers stand before her, clad in loose and comfortable-looking white. An androgynous-looking one in the centre, and behind them a boy and girl, forming a triangle.

"I'm Rebis," says the androgynous one. Sabah looks to the boy and the girl, but they apparently don't feel the need to introduce themselves.

"Parian," she says with a little curtsy.

"Really? I could've sworn you were Vista."

It's not a good joke, or even really a joke at all, but Parian laughs a little anyways, because that's called salesmanship.

"My siblings and I have a bet," Rebis continues. "Maybe you can help us settle it? See, we know the owner of this place. He's a sad old creep who yells whenever he sees us on the street, and all our friends too. We didn't do nothing to him, but he hates us anyway. So in revenge we were taking bets: do you think this new Vista fixation from him is like a fetish thing, or...?"

Instinctively, Parian glances into the shop. She can't make out anything in the darkness inside. The client could be just past the veil, listening to their every word.

"I don't think I can comment on that," she answers diplomatically. "But if you're not going to buy something..."

Rebis and their siblings scoff in synchrony. "Come on," Rebis snaps, "don't be boring. We'll buy something. But first you'll give us your honest assessment."

The client almost certainly isn't hiding just past the veil, listening to their every word. Because that would be a very silly thing to do.

"I don't think it's a fetish thing," Sabah whispers anyways. "I didn't get that vibe from him. I think he's very lonely and a bit lost, and... and he's fixating on something from the before time. A lot of people are. It works as a marketing thing."

She also thinks he's from another planet, but she declines to share that part.

"I think you're right," Rebis smiles. Along with their sister, they turn to the brother of the trio with hands outstretched. "You lost. Pay up."

"Ugh. The fetish thing was funnier."

He pays each of them in rough-looking coins that Parian doesn't recognize, almost like pebbles painted in black and white.

"We don't accept those," Parian interjects, "for what you're buying."

"Oh, we have your world's money too," Rebis's sister laughs. As Parian shifts to get out of the way, the trio turns to inspecting the merchandise.

"What's that?" Rebis points at something at the bottom of the pile.

"Uh..." Parian looks at it, then at the price sheet, then resorts to digging the item out. She holds it up, and verifies that it is on the sheet, at the very bottom. "It's, uh, a gun. Vista-branded gun. And ammunition."

"How cute. You're not going to run a background check on us?"

Parian shrugs.

"Then we'll take it. You have potential, little birdie. We'll see you around."

And so the day goes.

When night falls only the scraps remain. The owner directs Sabah to gather them up and then points her towards the dumpster out back. He pays her the agreed-upon amount.

She stalks homeward.

---

A block from her home Sabah passes a frail old woman in elaborate white robes, perched precariously on top of a cast-iron fence. She twitches like an insect as she scribbles into a well-loved notepad.

Sabah cranes her neck up to look.

"Hi, Hosanna," she calls.

"Sabah, dear," comes the answering croak. "How are you, child?"

"I'm well. Just got out of work. Brand promotion consultant, you know."

"Yes, good, that's good, we always need more of those... and your family?"

"Well, they're well too," Sabah answers with a little less enthusiasm. "Can I ask how you are? How's the stageplay's coming along?"

"But of course, of course. It's progressing nicely. A little *too* nicely... the characters are getting away from me, to be honest. They've been doing things that were not in the outline, not at all. I had to give them a stern talking-to, you understand."

The creature's laughter blares down from its perch.

"I see," Sabah says, because she doesn't. "And, um. I like the dress. Is it vintage?"

"Oh no, freshly made. Freshly woven. They have a very strict dress code, the ones in white."

Suddenly Sabah remembers she has a desperate need to be at home. Yes, she needs to talk to her mother and auntie about... astrology. Yes, urgently so. Planet X is at the periapsis of its orbit. Its passage is going to disrupt the gravitational factors behind brain chemistries and such, change everyone's behaviour for the second time. This is all proven by science and important. They need to come up with a plan for when it starts.

"Sabah? I don't know what you mean, dear. Could you slow down?"

Sabah clears her throat. "I'm sorry, I'd better be getting home. It's important."

"Of course. Thank you for stopping to talk to an old lady."

She turns to go.

"Sabah?" asks the thing on the fence.

She stops.

"You're right about that change, dear. It's all in the script. But first it's waiting for you to prove you were born for the stage. Will you let it in?"

Oh god.

---

In the bunk above, Fatima twists and turns long into the night. Thrice she cries out in terror, waking the whole house up.

Sabah's grateful for the distraction. Her own nightmares are seductive. They don't wake her at all.

---

"*Humans of Brockton Bay,*" the loudspeaker whimpers, "*cocaine and other stimulants can be used to keep you awake indefinitely. There is a large pile of cocaine sitting in the old warehouse off Northeast Market Boulevard. Because of a scheduling mishap, it will be unguarded for the next thirty-eight minutes... if-*" here a loud bout of sobbing interrupts the message, "*if you do choose to sleep, remember not to make any deals with the creatures you meet in dreams, unless they know the passphrase: foiled and flayed.*"

Parian is not up and at 'em. She's distinctly otherwise. Though she is just barely awake and going in their general direction, both of those are reluctant. If she could be a pathetic slug crawling halfheartedly away from 'em, she would be. She's not looking forward to this one.

She knocks on the apartment door. No answer comes, and she knocks again. She tries the door handle. It's open.

The home Sabah enters is disturbingly clean and well-decorated. She's grown used to a layer of dirt on everything, to hairline cracks along every surface, to no one having the time or care to bother with details. This isn't that. She feels like she's seeing the inside of one of those stereotyped 1950s white picket fence houses.

She would wonder if she's gone back in time, but there's a creepy doll sitting on the living room couch. It, and it alone, is filthy and unkempt. Half its hair is missing, the other half is practically straw. Makeup and markers mar its skin and dress. It stares at her with empty eyes.

Parian stares back. She's *so* not about to lose this staring contest, that she doesn't even notice the disturbingly well-dressed man emerging from somewhere unseen.

"Mara!" the client exclaims. She whips around to face him, but he's not even looking at her as he speaks. "Why, you're home from school early!"

He's looking at the doll, she realizes, talking to the doll. Ugh.

"Mara? Are you alright? You're not moving."

Ugh indeed. But then, she knew this was the job. Parian makes the doll stand up and hop down from the sofa. The client raises his arms for a hug, and the doll runs towards him. He kneels down, and the pair wrap their arms around each other. He's already crying.

"Oh, Mara. I'm so glad you're safe, baby. I k-knew you wouldn't die to that Endbringer. You'd never ever leave me alone like that. No you wouldn't, baby."

She makes 'Mara' lean further into the hug, but that's not going to be enough.

"Mara? Why aren't you answering me?"

As has been explained already, Parian cannot do sound effects. Luckily, or unluckily in this case, she has a voice of her own.

"It's okay, dad," she drones, "I made it out okay. The heroes saved me."

The client looks at Parian for the first time, and that look is a frown. "She called me daddy," he mutters.

"I don't care. I'm calling you dad."

"Seriously? I'm paying you a lot of money. You're going to let the choice of word my daughter called me get in the way of that?"

Fucking hell.

"It's okay, daddy."

He pats 'Mara' on the head and stands up. "You should unpack your school supplies."

"I don't-"

"You put your bag on the kitchen counter, remember? It's still there, I haven't touched it. And you can tell me about your day while you do."

Mara waddles over to her backpack and levitates up to her backpack. She swats at the zipper, and Parian pulls it open with her power.

"So? Your day?"

"It was okay. They taught me loads."

Mara makes an earnest attempt at pulling her binders out of the backpack, but tiny doll hands make that impossible. Parian wanders over and begins unpacking with her own hands, handing each item to Mara to be dropped on the granite countertop.

"Oh? Like what?"

Sabah struggles to think back to that age. She's never even been to American grade school. Instead, this situation is reminding her of university engineering course, and not for the right reasons.

"Um, trigonometry."

"Really! My baby, so advanced for her age! And what did you play with your friends at recess?"

"What are my friends' names?" Mara asks, stalling.

"Well... there's that Allan. He's your 'boyfriend', though if you ask me you're not old enough for one. Then there's Midge. She's been your best friend since you were little. And little Ryan. You met her when her family lived just across the hall."

"We played tag. Um, Allan double crossed me. He kept insisting I needed him, that I owed him because he saved me last game. We were going to find the perfect hiding spot together, and he just needed my help to get to it. When we found it he tagged me, because he was 'it' the whole time. He ran away laughing and yelling about how easy I was."

"I see."

"He's a bitch. Who would do that to someone?"

"Don't I know it," he laughs. "Come and give me another hug, Mara baby. I'll protect you. I'm just so glad you're alright."

This time the hug lasts nearly ten minutes, him rubbing circles in Mara's hair all the while. Sabah's glad of the break from the terrible roleplay, but she instead spends the interval stewing in her anger. She clenches her fists. Various lightweight objects around the apartment ripple and rage.

"That's good," the man says, standing up. "I'd better get started on dinner. Your mom should be home any second now, and she'll be so happy to have you back."

Parian looks at the door, horrified at the idea of another hideous puppet walking in, or a thousand times worse, a living human woman come to witness her humiliation. When no one arrives, she realizes the client is looking to her.

"You've got to be kidding me."

"Can't you move around and control her at the same time? I just figured, since you're only standing around-"

"No. No. Fuck no. This isn't a part of our deal."

"Come on. You're acting like I'm asking for something inappropriate here. You'll give us a hug and then you and I will make dinner together. We'll eat it and watch TV together and talk about work. We'll tuck her into bed. That's it."

She remembers the voice of the boy from university. *Come on,* he said, sounding so self-assured, *it's not like I'm asking for a lot here.*

So Parian does what she couldn't do, back then. She lashes out.

A dozen needles emerge from the recesses of her sleeves and pin the man to the wall. His fancy clothes drag him upward by the collar until his head presses against the ceiling and he gasps for breath.

She watches him flail for a very long time. Finally, she asks him where the money is.

"No- I won't- let me down! You think I'll pay you for this?!"

One more needle, her last needle, emerges from Parian's sleeve and hovers before his eye. He pales.

"You'll pay for my time, and we'll go our separate ways. I wouldn't complain. You're clearly a Simurgh bomb. She's driven you mad. Someone else might kill you just to remove the threat. I'm not going to do that to you."

He laughs uproariously for a moment, freezing as the associated head movement almost sticks the needle in his eye. "We're all Simurgh bombs," he hisses, "you sound pathetic. Don't you know where you are?"

"That sounds like a no," Parian sighs. Shit. She's not actually about to torture this guy. Is she?

"Yeah it's a no! Fuck you! You won't hurt me! You're an *entertainer*!"

She stares at him. Then her head hangs. The floating needle regresses into her sleeve. Even now, she can't fight back.

*Shit. Fuck. Fuck.*

"Now let me down! And get the fuck out of our home! I should rip you to pieces!"

Parian stands frozen for a humiliating moment, before the words register in her psyche. An idea follows them in.

"Mara," she says, looking at the child. "Why don't you rip *yourself* to pieces?"

She doesn't have to ask out loud, of course, but she feels the effect, the power her words carry. The man freezes instantly. Mara reaches for her shoulder and begins to tug one of her arms out of its socket. Bloody fluff bursts from her seams.

"No! Fuck you! That's my daughter! She's all I have left!"

With a rip, Mara tears the whole arm out. She's an animal, mauling herself, sacrificing herself to Sabah's will and worship. She starts clawing and biting at her foot next.

"Stop! Stop! It's in the bathroom! There's a loose ceiling panel! The money's there, just leave her be!"

She stops.

"Go and fetch your dad's money, Mara," Sabah orders, "there's a good girl."

Limping, the girl does.

When she emerges from the apartment complex she screams, raw and primal and piercing. She falls to her knees as passers-by hurry away in alarm. The scream becomes a roar, and their various clothes jostle them away faster. Only then does Sabah go silent.

For a few seconds, at least. Then comes the hyperventilating, just like the man she left pinned against the ceiling. Her vision swims. She tries to stand up and fails.

She can't keep doing this. She can't.

She looks up at the wall that surrounds everything, at the eerie gloom it casts upon the city. Before any of this, all of this, she was making *progress*. She was advertising for fashion brands, for big toy stores. Her life was as sane as any parahuman's could be.

Then the Simurgh came, and Sabah fought her, and Sabah lost. Everyone lost. And life moved on in Brockton Bay, but now what fashion brand is about to advertise in a quarantine zone? It's all madmen. Madmen and monsters.

It's a new world, but she hasn't been living in it. She realizes that now. She's only been surviving, and she can't survive any longer. Not like this.

So fuck them. Fuck them all. She'll put on her own show. She just needs to make it count.

Sabah stands up, and starts walking towards her resurrection.
