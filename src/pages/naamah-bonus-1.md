Every night, the demon showed Alice a new way she could die. And every morning, she woke up screaming. In the first weeks after the nightmares began, she'd have done anything to manage to stay awake for a single night.

So Naamah gave her just that. A long sleepless night, with just the two of them.

"Kill yourself," the voice from the core of her soul repeated, as it had for hours. If Alice didn't know better, she could have mistaken it for her own. She had, at first.

She tried to twitch her lips. It worked. The rest of her body didn't.

"I won't let you take me," she rasped. "The PRT will figure out what you're doing and get you out. They have people for that, e-even masters like you. If you tell me what you really want, I can speak on your behalf. I can help. Please."

"I want to see you die," it growled, sultry now. "I won't be satisfied unless you're screaming when it happens, you stupid slut. Crushing, burning, hanging, burying, vivisecting. I've shown you so many. Won't you tell me which you're going to pick?"

Alice trembled. But she never surrendered.

"If you wanted me dead you'd have killed me with my own hands."

"Maybe I'd find that boring," Naamah hissed. "Maybe it's not the same unless you take the last step for yourself. Maybe I've learned that relationships have to be more give and take than I thought. Or maybe I'm going to show you all the possibilities and then choose one for you. Speak up, tell me what you think, pet."

"Why me? Why are you really doing this?"

"I'm glad you asked that," the demon purred. It twisted Alice's neck around painfully to look towards the *other* girl lying across the room, sleeping soundly. "You see... it's about true love."

It took Alice far too long to realize what she was looking at.

"*Eve*?"

The sleeping girl didn't awaken, though her eyelashes seemed to flutter in recognition. Her face was utterly innocent and serene, in a way that Alice had never quite seen her manage during waking hours. Not for lack of trying.

Alice didn't know when her ex-girlfriend had begun sleeping in her room in the Wards Headquarters. She only knew that every time she planned to raise it as an issue, she suddenly found herself elsewhere, doing something far more urgent. Like fighting by Eve's side.

"True love? You're doing all of this because I broke up with *Eve*?"

Naamah giggled. It was a horrible giggle, like a squadron of small rodents squeaking in pain.

"You think it's all about you. Of course you do. And, well, I *do* hate you. Before all this, you know, I hoped to have her work up to killing you for what you did to her. Even now, things would be so much easier if you did kill yourself. Then I wouldn't have to break my promise to her, and I wouldn't have to deal with this interminable doubt... if she really wants me or just wants me to play *you*."

Alice's blood ran cold. She realized for the first time that she was trembling wildly, seemingly beyond the ability of Naamah's chains to suppress.

"It's because of her that that you're alive right now, and *only* because of her. You know what that means, little Alice? It means she saved your life."

"You... and her? *Th-That's* what this is all about? This whole time?"

"You should thank her for her mercy."

"Fuck that! I-I won't let you-"

"Thank her! And I'll let you sleep tonight. I'll even make the dream an easy one. Let's say... dying during a botched surgery. Under local anesthetic."

There was only one thing to be done.

"Thank you, Eve. Thank you for saving my life."

Naamah appeared in the darkness as a shadowy figure, smiling. It coiled around Eve, the demon around the goddess.

"You're a terrible actress, Alice. Once more, with feeling."

"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
